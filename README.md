This C++ implementation creates an engaging multiplayer experience where players roll the dice, navigate ladders, and evade snakes in a quest to be the first to reach 100.

The game begins by prompting the number of players, and each player provides their name. Players take turns rolling the dice, with the face value adding to their total score. Excitement builds as ladders boost scores, snakes present challenges, and the race to reach 100 unfolds iteratively.

The STL queue class efficiently manages player turns, ensuring a fair and dynamic gameplay experience. The repository showcases template-based programming, adherence to code structure, and extensive comments for easy understanding.
